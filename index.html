          <p>With a largely self-taught style, informed by a classical music education at one of the highest institutions in the land, Sadiki Saunders writes unique musical compositions out of synths, collected sound samples, recordings, and whatever else he can scrape together. Though he had been writing music since 2011, his first professional release was 2015's <i>KHz Cetacea</i>, a concept LP based on Nam June Paik's absurdist <i>Danger Music for Dick Higgins</i>. Since then, he's released a number of albums, EPs and LPs, often focusing on one particular element of composition, such as the focus on disconcordance in <i>The Year of the Gadfly</i> or the compound time signatures in <i>Odds and Ends</i></p>
    
          <p>On the nature of his work, Saunders has commented that "My music is often very personal, but not in the way that most people think of personal art. Besides <i>Please Help Amy</i>, which was based around my recovery from a period of suicidal depression, none of my albums are directly related to events that happened to me or deep, personal thoughts and ideas spawned directly from the artist's muse. I save <i>that</i> for my literary experiments. No, I write albums based on funny internet blogs. I write LPs based on avant-garde compositions that instruct one to crawl inside a living whale. In the major scheme of things, they are unimportant, silly things that have no effect on the world at large. How much more satisfying it is then, to commemorate them with music and turn them into stuff people write songs about by virtue of writing songs about them?"</p>
